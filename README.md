# G_5.2

G_5.2 is a canon-first structured inquiry runtime for a versioned authored persona.

The repo is organized around a simple baseline:
- `packages/canon` defines identity, epistemics, continuity, glossary terms, and recovered-artifact governance
- `packages/orchestration` builds turns from active canon via `draft -> critique -> revise -> memory decision`
- `packages/evals` pressure-tests the runtime and writes inspectable JSON reports
- `apps/dashboard` lets the operator inspect reports, compare diffs, and run persisted inquiries

The first goal is coherence and legibility, not theatrical complexity.

## Current Scope

Implemented now:
- active-canon retrieval with continuity facts, glossary terms, and selectively retrieved recovered artifacts
- multi-pass response orchestration
- provider abstraction through OpenRouter-backed providers
- canon boundary validation
- eval reports with trace capture and metadata
- minimal inquiry session persistence with rolling summaries and recent-turn carryover
- selective durable memory with global/session scope, confirmation-based dedupe, and operator delete
- operator dashboard for report inspection, diffing, session inspection, and memory inspection
- minimal operator inquiry surface backed by persisted sessions, stored context snapshots, and inspectable memory

Not implemented yet:
- manual memory create/edit/approval workflow
- canon proposal/editorial workflow

## Bootstrap

Prerequisites:
- Node `>=20`
- `pnpm >=9`

Install and verify:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@9
pnpm install
pnpm validate:canon
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm evals -- --trace
pnpm dashboard
```

Environment setup:
- copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- optionally set `EVAL_PROVIDER=openai|anthropic|gemini` (defaults to `gemini`)

Operator surfaces:
- reports/diff dashboard: `http://localhost:4400/`
- inquiry surface: `http://localhost:4400/inquiry.html`

## Notes

- Recovered artifacts are historically authoritative and behaviorally non-binding.
- Output does not become canon unless explicitly promoted.
- Durable memory is selective, file-backed, and lower priority than canon, continuity, session summaries, and recent turns.
- Canon changes should be versioned and recorded in `packages/canon/changelog/`.
